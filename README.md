# Live-Project-Summary

# Introduction

Over the course of two weeks, I became part of a team and was tasked with offensive and defense projects to express what I have learned throughout this experience! During my time with my team, I was able to get extensive use out of multiple tools such as burp suite, developer tools, wire shark, and also sql map. My work consits on security on the back and front end, in which i am very proud of. In the beginning of the project I experienced what a sprint was and participated in daily stand ups with the team to discuss what was happening presently, what we will do next, and if their were any roadblocks. Below are snippets of some of my accomplishments during my recruitment on the team.

# CAPTCHA - Offensive

I was tasked to send mulitple requests to my clients captcha.

# Exposed Administration Account - Offensive

During the entire two weeks, this was probably one of my favorite task because it was also one of the most challenging for me. It actually pushed me beyond my limits such as being able to reach out for to peers for discussions, and also thinking outside of the box. I was tasked to search into someone else's basket and locate the admin hidden page and delete all 5 star reviews from the page.

The goal here was to look over a malicious file that a friend downloaded and recover where and who it came from.
